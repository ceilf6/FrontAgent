# Changelog

## 2.2.0

## 2.0.0

- Kept the VS Code extension version aligned with the root `frontagent` package.

## 1.0.3

- Added FrontAgent extension logs through a dedicated output channel.

- Fixed the Activity Bar icon path with a dedicated monochrome SVG icon.
- Reworked the sidebar into a chat-first FrontAgent experience.

- Documented the two supported FrontAgent usage modes: CLI and VS Code.

## 0.1.0

- Initial VS Code sidebar task console for FrontAgent.
